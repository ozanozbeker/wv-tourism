Stunted red spruce, ancient bogs and forlorn boulders define this haunting landscape, where creatures typically found in more northern environs roam oblivious to their geologic isolation. The Nature Conservancy’s 477-acre Bear Rocks Preserve is a cornerstone of this wonderfully diverse and complex ecosystem, which lies on a ridge crest that forms part of the Eastern Continental Divide. Whipping, whistling wind greets visitors to Bear Rock’s barren expanse, where the undulating mountains of the east fold out across the skyline. Dotting this view are large birds of prey that ride warm air currents rising from the valley below, while colorful warblers, vireos, thrushes and other songbirds hug low to the ground, where a profusion of plant life provides protection and food. Lightly treaded trails entwine throughout the preserve’s unique plant communities, leading hikers through a variety of shrubs like blueberry, huckleberry, mountain laurel, azalea and rhododendron. In some areas, soggy, decay-logged soil supports unique high-elevation cranberry bogs, which flourish each autumn. Throughout, red spruce trees poke from patches of soil, and are at once both nurtured and hampered by the icy cool climate. Secreted away amidst these plant communities is an assortment of unique creatures that cling heartily to the unforgiving landscape. Here, lucky travelers might catch a glimpse of the Cheat Mountain salamander, on the federal threatened and endangered species list.

Washington had a major influence on southern race relations and was the dominant figure in black public affairs from 1895 until his death in 1915. Born into slavery and illiteracy, Washington rose up to become the foremost educator and leader of black Americans at the turn of the century. In 1865, the nine-year-old Booker walked with his family 225 miles from Hales Ford, VA, to his freedom home in Malden. There he labored as a salt-packer and worked in the coal mines before becoming a houseboy for the wife of Lewis Ruffner, owner of the mines. She encouraged Booker to continue his education and, in 1872, he entered the Hampton Agricultural Institute. A forceful speaker, Washington became skilled in politics. Powerful and influential in both white and black communities, Washington was a confidential advisor to U.S. presidents. For years, presidential political appointments of African Americans were cleared through Washington. A man who overcame near-impossible odds himself, Booker T. Washington is best remembered for helping black Americans rise up from the economic slavery that held them down for so long after they were legally free citizens.",,,,"4104 Malden Drive, Malden, WV, 25112",2020-07-28T15:31:31Z

It survives today as a well-preserved example of one of West Virginia’s most ambitious Works Progress Administration (WPA) projects. The camp was renamed by West Virginia State College for Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver. Continued use of Camp Washington-Carver for educational and entertainment purposes was assured in 1979 when ownership of the complex was passed to the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. Programs like the African-American Heritage Arts Camp and the Appalachian String Band Festival, along with the camp's Great Chestnut Lodge, the largest log structure of its kind in the world, make this site a favorite place for Mountain State festivities.

In the October battle of Greenbrier River, troops from Cheat Summit Fort, under General R. H. Milroy, attacked Camp Bartow. Neither side could claim victory and the Union troops returned to Cheat Summit Fort while the Confederates withdrew to Camp Allegheny. In December of the same year, soldiers from Cheat Summit Fort attacked Camp Allegheny, but were driven back.

Bogs are acidic wetlands more commonly found in the northern areas of this country and in Canada. The ground in a bog is spongy and consists largely of partially-decayed plant material known as peat. Because of its unique conditions, some unusual plants grow in bogs, including carnivorous or insect-eating plants. The Botanical Area encompasses 750 acres. The Cranberry Glades consists of four bogs whose plant and animal life is similar to that found in the bogs or ""muskegs"" of the north. This life spread southward with the changing climatic conditions that allowed glaciers to creep across the northern part of our continent. Several species ended their migration here, and the Cranberry Glades are now the southern-most point in North America where some of these life forms are found. A half-mile boardwalk has been constructed through two of the bogs so you can enjoy the area without disturbing this fragile community. Help protect these bogs and stay on the boardwalk, and leave the flowers for others to enjoy.",http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/mnf/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,,,"932 North Fork Cherry Rd., Richwood, WV, 26261",2021-07-21T19:24:42Z

https://wvtourism.com/company/cranesville-swamp-nature-preserve/,Cranesville Swamp Nature Preserve,"At Cranesville Swamp the elements of wind, water, mountains, and temperature have created a landscape that is both beautiful and rare. In combination, these climactic elements have produced a natural occurrence known as a “frost pocket” – a low area that collects moisture and cooler temperatures. As weather travels west-to-east across North America, the hills surrounding Cranesville Swamp channel precipitation and chilled air into the valley, which make the preserve one of the coolest and soggiest spots in West Virginia. The cool, wet environment of Cranesville Swamp has over thousands of years fostered the formation of peat – made of compacted sphagnum moss that creates a nutrient-poor environment as it breaks down. Few trees can survive in the resulting bog, but tall eastern hemlock, red spruce and tamarack prevail in the acidic environment. Lower to the ground, plants like sundew, cranberry and sedge thrive in open areas.  Throughout these rare and diverse wetlands communities, visitors to the preserve can witness a spectacular range of birds and mammals. Lucky visitors may spot the rare northern water shrew, or catch a glimpse of a bear rummaging through the shrub thickets surrounding Muddy Creek. Patience and binoculars may afford others a glimpse of any one of the more than 100 bird species found at Cranesville, such as alder flycatcher, Blackburnian warbler, or the saw-whet owl – which nests in stands of red spruce and hemlock in the conifer swamp forest. This 2,000 acre preserve straddling Maryland and West Virginia features five trails, including a 1,500 foot boardwalk.

https://wvtourism.com/company/grandview-new-river-gorge-national-river/,Grandview (New River Gorge National Park & Preserve),"Grandview provides some of the most dramatic scenery found in the park and is a popular place for hiking, picnicking, and sight seeing. Grandview is a peaceful place to relax and unwind while enjoying outstanding views of the New River. From 1400 feet above the river at Main Overlook, visitors are rewarded with one of the most outstanding views in the park. On a clear day you can see directly into the heart of New River Gorge National Park & Preserve, including seven miles of the New River and its watershed. From Main Overlook visitors can also get a glimpse of some of the gorge's unique cultural history. From here you see an active railway and the town of Quinnimont, where the first coal was shipped out of the gorge in 1873. Don't miss the views from Turkey Spur Overlook, and be sure to walk the woodland trails. Grandview is a great place to see the spectacular displays of Catawba rhododendrons that bloom here every spring. The purple Catawba rhododendrons bloom in mid May, while the white great rhododendrons bloom in July. The exact bloom times are not always consistent year to year, so check with a ranger at one of our visitor centers or check our facebook page for updates. The Grandview section of the park includes overlooks of the New River, a visitor center (open seasonally), five hiking trails, ranger-led walks and talks, summer outdoor dramas, and picnic areas with playgrounds. Information about renting picnic shelters at Grandview can be found on the Permits and Reservations page of our website. Grandview is home to Theatre West Virginia, which features outdoor drama presentations from June through August. Grandview was originally a part of the West Virginia State Park system. In 1939, the state of West Virginia purchased 52 acres of land at Grandview to develop a day use park. The Civilian Conservation Corps built roads, shelters, and a picnic area, all still in use today. Construction began in 1960 on the 1200-seat Cliffside Amphitheater. The children’s playgrounds, recreation area, and additional walkways were built from 1961 to 1964. After more than 50 years as one of West Virginia’s most popular state parks, Grandview was transferred to the National Park Service in 1990.",https://www.nps.gov/neri/index.htm/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,(304) 763-3715,Heath_Fitzpatrick@nps.gov,"P.O.

Beginning as a homestead farm, the farm has seen many different faces over the years. The early years were all about eggs and at its peak saw 15,000 chickens on the farm. The eggs were delivered door to door around the Kanawha Valley. The 70s and 80s saw a lot of grain farming along the Kanawha River in Buffalo and Winfield. In the mid 1980s, the visionary 2nd generation farmer, Lee Gritt, moved farming indoors and begin building greenhouses.

This label was well earned, as according to McCoy, by 1984, the town had faced severe, property damaging flooding in 33 of the prior 35 years. The most catastrophic floods occurred in 1957, 1963, 1977 and 1984. You can see the heights that these floods reached on the steps that lead to the river, and even as high as the floodwall. Relief came in 1992 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began constructing the 2,350-foot long floodwall. Since the construction of the wall, there hasn’t been an instance of significant flooding within the downtown Matewan area.",http://www.historicmatewan.com/photos/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,(304) 426-4522,info@historicmatewan.com,"Main Street, Matewan, WV, 25678",2020-08-03T15:25:01Z

https://wvtourism.com/company/mccollochs-leap/,McColloch’s Leap,"In September 1777, during a Native American siege on the fort, Major Samuel McColloch arrived at the fort with 40 mounted men from Short Creek. The gates of the fort were thrown open to allow the men entrance. Major McColloch lingered behind to guide and protect the men. The Indians attacked, and all of the men except McColloch made it inside before they were forced to close the gates. McColloch found himself alone and surrounded by Native Americans, and he rode immediately towards the nearby hill in an attempt to escape. McColloch had earned a reputation as a very successful ""borderer"" (one who protected the frontier borders from the Native Americans) and was well known to both the frontiersmen and the Indians. The Indians eagerly pursued McColloch, and drove him to the summit of the hill. As he rode along the top of the hill, he encountered another large body of Indians. He now found himself surrounded, with no path of escape. He knew, because of his reputation and history against the Indians, he would be tortured and killed with great cruelty if he were to be captured alive. With all avenues of escape cut off, he turned and faced the precipice, and with the bridle in his left hand and his rifle in his right, he spurred his horse over the edge to an almost certain death. The hill at that location is about 300 feet in height, and in many places is almost perpendicular. The Indians rushed to the edge, expecting to see the major lying dead in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the hill. To their great surprise, they instead saw McColloch, still mounted on his white horse, galloping away from them. As legend of this famous ""leap"" became known, the place where it occurred became known as McColloch's Leap. A historical marker now memorializes the site of his daring feat.",,(800) 828-3097,info@wheelingcvb.com,"100-122 National Rd., Wheeling, West Virginia, 26003",2020-08-14T17:57:25Z

We carry many West Virginia wines, local honey, different jams and jellies, apple butter, sauces from Oliverio’s Peppers in Clarksburg—in fact, we're so local that some of the honey we will be selling are from the bees that were in our apple orchard for pollinating earlier this spring! We have farm fresh produce, bulk candy, pies, organic ice cream, local meats, baking mixes, organic milk, local free range eggs from Gerrardstown, tomatoes, and much more in season. What we don’t raise ourselves, we are buying from local farmers when available so our customers will have different types of produce to choose from when they walk in our market. This is the best our great area produces, and our family is so happy to bring it all together to share with your family. Taylor's Farm Market is conveniently located right off I-81 in Inwood, WV and opened in May 2014. However, you've seen our family in the Inwood community for a long time: Nearby, owners Bob Taylor and his son Ryan Taylor farm over 1350 acres of row crops and orchards. The Taylor's farm produces over 130,000 bushels of apples, 5,000 bushels of peaches, cherries, plums, and nectarines that are sold in the farm market along with a huge variety of other local produce. Our spot right off the highway here in Inwood has been a place for wholesome, local food for a long time. In 1920 the site was originally developed into the Demonstration Community Apple Packing School. Many apple producers came here to learn best practices for packing the fruit via 12 orchards that sent 120,000 barrels of apples here. It was also a place to have the fruit inspected and graded before shipping it to market on the Cumberland Valley Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The facility was later the Inwood Farmer's Market, pictured above, although the original building pictured burned in 1955. The current building allows us sample space to share the best locally produced fruit, wines, grocery items, dairy, meat, handmade crafts, and bakery items that West Virginia proudly produces.",http://www.taylorfarmsmarket.com/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,(304) 400-6123,info@taylorfarmsmarket.com,"178 Pilgrim Street, Inwood, WV, 25428",2020-08-04T16:47:51Z

As you move into the center of the property you find a more mature forest of large oaks and maples growing amid limestone outcrops and sinkholes. The eastern edge of the property is a bluff overlooking the Potomac River. The mixed habitat makes the area ideal for birding. The preserve is a hot spot for Spring wildflower displays, as well as sighting warblers on migration. At least 105 species of plants have been identified on the Preserve. Clusters of wildflowers such as Dutchmen's Breeches, Jack-in-the-Pulpit, Hepatica, and Twinleaf are easily found in the spring. The autumn fruits of Paw Paw trees provide a snack for wild animals and not-so-wild hikers alike. There is equal diversity among the animals on the Preserve. Spring migration of waterfowl can be spectacular along the river. Breeding season welcomes sweet-singing warblers and vireos as they nest among the cedars. Barred Owls are often heard as they cry out in search for a mate. Three well marked trails take the visitor through a variety of habitat types on the preserve. The ""Kingfisher Trail,"" a ""South Trail,"" and ""Dan Fisher Trail"" all loop, and one can walk a large circle across the property. A trail brochure is available on site.
