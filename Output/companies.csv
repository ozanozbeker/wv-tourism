Bear Rocks Preserve,"Time stands still high above Canaan Valley, in Dolly Sods, where a flat, windswept expanse of subalpine heath barrens opens up to the sky. Stunted red spruce, ancient bogs and forlorn boulders define this haunting landscape, where creatures typically found in more northern environs roam oblivious to their geologic isolation. The Nature Conservancy’s 477-acre Bear Rocks Preserve is a cornerstone of this wonderfully diverse and complex ecosystem, which lies on a ridge crest that forms part of the Eastern Continental Divide. Whipping, whistling wind greets visitors to Bear Rock’s barren expanse, where the undulating mountains of the east fold out across the skyline. Dotting this view are large birds of prey that ride warm air currents rising from the valley below, while colorful warblers, vireos, thrushes and other songbirds hug low to the ground, where a profusion of plant life provides protection and food. Lightly treaded trails entwine throughout the preserve’s unique plant communities, leading hikers through a variety of shrubs like blueberry, huckleberry, mountain laurel, azalea and rhododendron. In some areas, soggy, decay-logged soil supports unique high-elevation cranberry bogs, which flourish each autumn. Throughout, red spruce trees poke from patches of soil, and are at once both nurtured and hampered by the icy cool climate. Secreted away amidst these plant communities is an assortment of unique creatures that cling heartily to the unforgiving landscape. Here, lucky travelers might catch a glimpse of the Cheat Mountain salamander, on the federal threatened and endangered species list. Harder still to spot is the snowshoe hare or saw-whet owl, animals that typically are found further north.",(304) 637-0160,westvirginia@tnc.org,https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/westvirginia/placesweprotect/bear-rocks-preserve.xml/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,Forest Road 75,,,WV,26260,39.0220618,-79.3176365,https://wvtourism.com/company/bear-rocks-preserve/,2022-05-16T19:02:34Z

Beartown State Park,"The Park is actually one large rock formation split into sections and clefts large enough for walkways. The Park is noted for its massive boulders, overhanging cliffs and unusual rock formations, which are comprised of Pottsville Sandstone formed during the Pennsylvanian Age. Faulting and erosion of the sandstone capping the mountain created a unique system of ‘sunken streets’ in this ‘town of rocks.’ Huge rock formations, deep caves, and dark corners invite the imagination to speculate if bears really do inhabit the vicinity. Beartown State Park is a natural area. Its 107 acres are located on the eastern summit of Droop Mountain, seven miles southwest of Hillsboro, West Virginia. The land was purchased in 1970 with funds from the Nature Conservancy and a donation from Mrs. Edwin G. Polan, in memory of her son, Ronald Keith Neal, who lost his life in the Vietnam War. Development of the park has been minimal in order to preserve the natural attractions of the area. However, basic facilities are provided, and a boardwalk permits easy access.

Booker T. Washington Boyhood Cabin,"Located just behind the African Zion Baptist Church, Booker's cabin was built to match a photograph of his home. Booker T. Washington had a major influence on southern race relations and was the dominant figure in black public affairs from 1895 until his death in 1915. Born into slavery and illiteracy, Washington rose up to become the foremost educator and leader of black Americans at the turn of the century. In 1865, the nine-year-old Booker walked with his family 225 miles from Hales Ford, VA, to his freedom home in Malden. There he labored as a salt-packer and worked in the coal mines before becoming a houseboy for the wife of Lewis Ruffner, owner of the mines. She encouraged Booker to continue his education and, in 1872, he entered the Hampton Agricultural Institute. A forceful speaker, Washington became skilled in politics. Powerful and influential in both white and black communities, Washington was a confidential advisor to U.S. presidents. For years, presidential political appointments of African Americans were cleared through Washington. A man who overcame near-impossible odds himself, Booker T. Washington is best remembered for helping black Americans rise up from the economic slavery that held them down for so long after they were legally free citizens.",,,,4104 Malden Drive,Malden,Kanawha County,WV,25306,38.2995758,-81.5571404,https://wvtourism.com/company/booker-t-washington-boyhood-cabin/,2020-07-28T15:31:31Z

Cheat Summit Fort,"General George B. McClellan ordered this fort to be built in 1861 to secure the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike and protect the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

In the October battle of Greenbrier River, troops from Cheat Summit Fort, under General R. H. Milroy, attacked Camp Bartow. Neither side could claim victory and the Union troops returned to Cheat Summit Fort while the Confederates withdrew to Camp Allegheny. In December of the same year, soldiers from Cheat Summit Fort attacked Camp Allegheny, but were driven back.

Cranberry Glades Botanical Area,"The Cranberry Glades Botanical Area protects the largest area of bogs in West Virginia. Bogs are acidic wetlands more commonly found in the northern areas of this country and in Canada. The ground in a bog is spongy and consists largely of partially-decayed plant material known as peat. Because of its unique conditions, some unusual plants grow in bogs, including carnivorous or insect-eating plants. The Botanical Area encompasses 750 acres. The Cranberry Glades consists of four bogs whose plant and animal life is similar to that found in the bogs or ""muskegs"" of the north. This life spread southward with the changing climatic conditions that allowed glaciers to creep across the northern part of our continent. Several species ended their migration here, and the Cranberry Glades are now the southern-most point in North America where some of these life forms are found. A half-mile boardwalk has been constructed through two of the bogs so you can enjoy the area without disturbing this fragile community. Help protect these bogs and stay on the boardwalk, and leave the flowers for others to enjoy.",,,http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/mnf/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,932 North Fork Cherry Road,Richwood,Nicholas County,WV,26261,38.2473344,-80.5251505,https://wvtourism.com/company/cranberry-glades-botanical-area/,2021-07-21T19:24:42Z

Cranesville Swamp Nature Preserve,"At Cranesville Swamp the elements of wind, water, mountains, and temperature have created a landscape that is both beautiful and rare. In combination, these climactic elements have produced a natural occurrence known as a “frost pocket” – a low area that collects moisture and cooler temperatures. As weather travels west-to-east across North America, the hills surrounding Cranesville Swamp channel precipitation and chilled air into the valley, which make the preserve one of the coolest and soggiest spots in West Virginia. The cool, wet environment of Cranesville Swamp has over thousands of years fostered the formation of peat – made of compacted sphagnum moss that creates a nutrient-poor environment as it breaks down. Few trees can survive in the resulting bog, but tall eastern hemlock, red spruce and tamarack prevail in the acidic environment. Lower to the ground, plants like sundew, cranberry and sedge thrive in open areas.  Throughout these rare and diverse wetlands communities, visitors to the preserve can witness a spectacular range of birds and mammals. Lucky visitors may spot the rare northern water shrew, or catch a glimpse of a bear rummaging through the shrub thickets surrounding Muddy Creek. Patience and binoculars may afford others a glimpse of any one of the more than 100 bird species found at Cranesville, such as alder flycatcher, Blackburnian warbler, or the saw-whet owl – which nests in stands of red spruce and hemlock in the conifer swamp forest. This 2,000 acre preserve straddling Maryland and West Virginia features five trails, including a 1,500 foot boardwalk.

Ghost Tours of Harpers Ferry,"The Ghost Tours of Harpers Ferry by ""O’ Be JoyFull"" is a 'Family & Dog Friendly' walking tour appriopriate for most people of all age. The tour is approximately 1&1/2 to 1 & 3/4 hours in length and takes you around several blocks of the historic ""Lower Town"" section of Harpers Ferry to view a number of sites and buildings that have had ghostly phenomenon reported in, or around them, over the years. You will be told about the unexplained, or ghostly phenomenon that has, or is still occurring, as well as stories of both legends and/or historical events, which may account for such unexplained ghostly happenings and encounters . Of course, with Harpers Ferry’s violent past, especially during the American Civil War, many of the stories will tell of death, and some background history of Harpers Ferry is also an element of the tour.

Ice Mountain Preserve,"Ice Mountain gets its name from the refrigeration effect that takes place inside its talus — a sloping mass of boulders at the foot of the mountain. In cooler months, dense, cold air sinks deep into the talus, and ice masses form inside. As the weather warms up, the cooler air flows out of vents among the rocks at the bottom of the slope. The preserve protects a collection of boreal plants usually found much further north. Sustained by the cool air flowing from some 60 small holes and openings at the base of the talus, species such as twinflower, dwarf dogwood, Canada mayflower, and bristly rose all can be found here. The 149-acre preserve also provides habitat for breeding neotropical birds such as warblers, vireos and thrushes, as well as a collection of birds and animals that are typical of the Central Appalachians.",,westvirginia@tnc.org,,County Route 45/20,Capon Bridge,Hampshire County,WV,26711,39.3414389,-78.487521,https://wvtourism.com/company/ice-mountain-preserve/,2020-08-12T14:44:10Z

Visitors walking the path see the art on the floodwall while enjoying the Tug Fork River. The floodwall may spend the majority of its time as a piece of information art, but it also serves an important function. According to the former mayor of Matewan, Robert McCoy, the town was once described as having the most severe flooding problem in the United States. This label was well earned, as according to McCoy, by 1984, the town had faced severe, property damaging flooding in 33 of the prior 35 years. The most catastrophic floods occurred in 1957, 1963, 1977 and 1984. You can see the heights that these floods reached on the steps that lead to the river, and even as high as the floodwall. Relief came in 1992 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began constructing the 2,350-foot long floodwall.

McColloch’s Leap,"In September 1777, during a Native American siege on the fort, Major Samuel McColloch arrived at the fort with 40 mounted men from Short Creek. The gates of the fort were thrown open to allow the men entrance. Major McColloch lingered behind to guide and protect the men. The Indians attacked, and all of the men except McColloch made it inside before they were forced to close the gates. McColloch found himself alone and surrounded by Native Americans, and he rode immediately towards the nearby hill in an attempt to escape. McColloch had earned a reputation as a very successful ""borderer"" (one who protected the frontier borders from the Native Americans) and was well known to both the frontiersmen and the Indians. The Indians eagerly pursued McColloch, and drove him to the summit of the hill. As he rode along the top of the hill, he encountered another large body of Indians. He now found himself surrounded, with no path of escape. He knew, because of his reputation and history against the Indians, he would be tortured and killed with great cruelty if he were to be captured alive. With all avenues of escape cut off, he turned and faced the precipice, and with the bridle in his left hand and his rifle in his right, he spurred his horse over the edge to an almost certain death. The hill at that location is about 300 feet in height, and in many places is almost perpendicular. The Indians rushed to the edge, expecting to see the major lying dead in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the hill. To their great surprise, they instead saw McColloch, still mounted on his white horse, galloping away from them. As legend of this famous ""leap"" became known, the place where it occurred became known as McColloch's Leap.

During the 1920's, a new highway was planned for construction on the property near the new school, so the school had to be moved from that area. Mr. Windrield Kinder used oxen to move the building approximately 100 feet away from the original site. Children attended this school until 1959, then were transferred to Peytona Grade School after the school closed. The school property was then sold by the Board of Education to a Mr. Workman. After the school was sold, the building remained empty on the property from 1959 until it was relocated to its present location in the John M.

Rosby’s Rock,"The inscribed bolder marks the spot, where on Dec. 24, 1852, the rails of the B&O were joined forming a railroad link between Baltimore (the Atlantic Ocean) and the Ohio River. This site is the original Promontory Point linking the two water drainages. Construction of the railroad was started on July 4, 1928, and its completion represented one of the major milestones in United States history and development. The railroad aided commerce and westward expansion. The town, best reached from Moundsville via County Road 54 and by following the signs, is located up a hollow along Big Grave Creek. The Rosbys Rock community of today, however, bears little resemblance to the prosperous railroading and farming hamlet in which Dorothy was reared. Very few of the “old-timers” who made their livings off the land or the railroad are alive.

The name Sumner came from a renowned Massachusetts senator, Charles Sumner, a strict abolitionist and foremost advocate of anti-slavery in Congress. Sumner gave such a forceful speech against the evils of slavery that it angered one of his fellow congressman, Preston Brooks, to the extent that he struck Sumner several times with his heavy cane.

What we don’t raise ourselves, we are buying from local farmers when available so our customers will have different types of produce to choose from when they walk in our market. This is the best our great area produces, and our family is so happy to bring it all together to share with your family. Taylor's Farm Market is conveniently located right off I-81 in Inwood, WV and opened in May 2014. However, you've seen our family in the Inwood community for a long time: Nearby, owners Bob Taylor and his son Ryan Taylor farm over 1350 acres of row crops and orchards. The Taylor's farm produces over 130,000 bushels of apples, 5,000 bushels of peaches, cherries, plums, and nectarines that are sold in the farm market along with a huge variety of other local produce. Our spot right off the highway here in Inwood has been a place for wholesome, local food for a long time. In 1920 the site was originally developed into the Demonstration Community Apple Packing School. Many apple producers came here to learn best practices for packing the fruit via 12 orchards that sent 120,000 barrels of apples here. It was also a place to have the fruit inspected and graded before shipping it to market on the Cumberland Valley Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The facility was later the Inwood Farmer's Market, pictured above, although the original building pictured burned in 1955. The current building allows us sample space to share the best locally produced fruit, wines, grocery items, dairy, meat, handmade crafts, and bakery items that West Virginia proudly produces.",(304) 400-6123,info@taylorfarmsmarket.com,http://www.taylorfarmsmarket.com/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,178 Pilgrim Street,Inwood,Berkeley County,WV,25428,39.3612877,-78.0426804,https://wvtourism.com/company/taylors-farm-market/,2020-08-04T16:47:51Z

West Virginia State University Capitol Center Theatre,"Opened as the Plaza Theatre in 1912, it featured high-class vaudeville entertainment and novel attractions. In 1921, the building was remodeled with a Wurlitzer pipe organ and a projector room. A 30 foot electrical sign and a marquee were addedon the front. The facility was renamed the Capitol Theater and offered silent movies and vaudeville. In 1923, a fire collapsed the roof; the loss estimate was $175,000. The owners rebuilt immediately and with “talkies” the theatre was wired for sound. In 1982, changes to the economy and the downtown community as well as competition from movie chain theatres forced it to close. In 1985, the theatre reopened as the Capitol Plaza. In 1991, the building was given to West Virginia State University and renamed the Capitol Center. It is open for walk-in tours from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays and during events.

The eastern edge of the property is a bluff overlooking the Potomac River. The mixed habitat makes the area ideal for birding. The preserve is a hot spot for Spring wildflower displays, as well as sighting warblers on migration. At least 105 species of plants have been identified on the Preserve. Clusters of wildflowers such as Dutchmen's Breeches, Jack-in-the-Pulpit, Hepatica, and Twinleaf are easily found in the spring. The autumn fruits of Paw Paw trees provide a snack for wild animals and not-so-wild hikers alike. There is equal diversity among the animals on the Preserve. Spring migration of waterfowl can be spectacular along the river. Breeding season welcomes sweet-singing warblers and vireos as they nest among the cedars. Barred Owls are often heard as they cry out in search for a mate. Three well marked trails take the visitor through a variety of habitat types on the preserve. The ""Kingfisher Trail,"" a ""South Trail,"" and ""Dan Fisher Trail"" all loop, and one can walk a large circle across the property. A trail brochure is available on site.
