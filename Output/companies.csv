Anna Jarvis was born in the village of Webster, Taylor County, West Virginia, on May 1, 1864, in a two-story wooden house built by her father, Granville E. Jarvis, in 1854.

Bear Rocks Preserve,"Time stands still high above Canaan Valley, in Dolly Sods, where a flat, windswept expanse of subalpine heath barrens opens up to the sky. Stunted red spruce, ancient bogs and forlorn boulders define this haunting landscape, where creatures typically found in more northern environs roam oblivious to their geologic isolation. The Nature Conservancy’s 477-acre Bear Rocks Preserve is a cornerstone of this wonderfully diverse and complex ecosystem, which lies on a ridge crest that forms part of the Eastern Continental Divide. Whipping, whistling wind greets visitors to Bear Rock’s barren expanse, where the undulating mountains of the east fold out across the skyline. Dotting this view are large birds of prey that ride warm air currents rising from the valley below, while colorful warblers, vireos, thrushes and other songbirds hug low to the ground, where a profusion of plant life provides protection and food. Lightly treaded trails entwine throughout the preserve’s unique plant communities, leading hikers through a variety of shrubs like blueberry, huckleberry, mountain laurel, azalea and rhododendron. In some areas, soggy, decay-logged soil supports unique high-elevation cranberry bogs, which flourish each autumn. Throughout, red spruce trees poke from patches of soil, and are at once both nurtured and hampered by the icy cool climate. Secreted away amidst these plant communities is an assortment of unique creatures that cling heartily to the unforgiving landscape. Here, lucky travelers might catch a glimpse of the Cheat Mountain salamander, on the federal threatened and endangered species list. Harder still to spot is the snowshoe hare or saw-whet owl, animals that typically are found further north.",4.9,(304) 637-0160,westvirginia@tnc.org,"Forest Rd 75, Davis, WV 26260, USA",Potomac Highlands,https://maps.google.com/?cid=6830669336434670290,https://wvtourism.com/company/bear-rocks-preserve/,https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/westvirginia/placesweprotect/bear-rocks-preserve.xml/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,NA,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,7:00 AM – 7:00 PM,7:00 AM – 7:00 PM,7:00 AM – 7:00 PM,7:00 AM – 7:00 PM,7:00 AM – 7:00 PM,7:00 AM – 7:00 PM,7:00 AM – 7:00 PM,39.0666395,-79.3013057,ChIJ4U9tn-8ztYkR0npXMJJpy14,Petersburg,Grant County,26847,Hiking

Beartown State Park,"The Park is actually one large rock formation split into sections and clefts large enough for walkways. The Park is noted for its massive boulders, overhanging cliffs and unusual rock formations, which are comprised of Pottsville Sandstone formed during the Pennsylvanian Age. Faulting and erosion of the sandstone capping the mountain created a unique system of ‘sunken streets’ in this ‘town of rocks.’ Huge rock formations, deep caves, and dark corners invite the imagination to speculate if bears really do inhabit the vicinity. Beartown State Park is a natural area. Its 107 acres are located on the eastern summit of Droop Mountain, seven miles southwest of Hillsboro, West Virginia. The land was purchased in 1970 with funds from the Nature Conservancy and a donation from Mrs. Edwin G. Polan, in memory of her son, Ronald Keith Neal, who lost his life in the Vietnam War. Development of the park has been minimal in order to preserve the natural attractions of the area. However, basic facilities are provided, and a boardwalk permits easy access. Interpretive signs along the boardwalk guide visitors and provide insights concerning the ecology of the area.",4.7,(304) 799-4087,beartownsp@wv.gov,"4800 Watoga Park Rd, Marlinton, WV 24954, USA",Potomac Highlands,https://maps.google.com/?cid=889491166160023914,https://wvtourism.com/company/beartown-state-park/,http://www.beartownstatepark.com/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,9:00 AM – 5:00 PM,9:00 AM – 5:00 PM,9:00 AM – 5:00 PM,9:00 AM – 5:00 PM,9:00 AM – 5:00 PM,9:00 AM – 5:00 PM,9:00 AM – 5:00 PM,38.101526799999995,-80.1513238,ChIJBTMqSOV8TIgRavHQvYAbWAw,Hillsboro,Pocahontas County,24946,Hiking

Byrnside Branch Farm,"Our family farm was purchased in March 1982. During that time the farm was a full operational dairy farm. The name was Dima Ja Diary, named after our registered cattle. Dima Ja Diary ran for almost 18 years before it switched over to agritourism. When the diary operation ceased and cattle left we changed the farm name to Byrnside Branch Farm because of the branch that runs through it. We began growing pumpkins, gourds, potatoes and started the corn maze with many activities during the fall season. Then, approximately eight years ago we began growing vegetables. In extended season, we utilize 3 high tunnels. We offer pick your own produce as well as selling through a local online farmers market that delivers to Charleston, WV once a week. Along with growing vegetables and doing the corn maze, we also farm a small beef cattle herd. Over the years our farm has also raised pigs, cattle, horses, lambs, and rabbits.

Craik-Patton House Museum,"Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, The Craik – Patton House is a splendid example of Greek Revival architecture in the Kanawha River Valley of West Virginia. Constructed in 1834, the Craik- Patton House or “Elm Grove” as it was known then, was built downtown Charleston, Virginia, now West Virginia, by James Craik, grandson of Dr. James Craik close friend and personal physician to President George Washington. Later, the home was purchased by Confederate Colonel George S. Patton I, grandfather of WW2 General George S. Patton. It was moved twice but ultimately was saved by the National Society of Colonial Dames in America in the State of West Virginia (NSCDAWV) and moved in 1973 to its current location.

Gauley River Wild & Woolly Primitive Campground,"NOT YOUR RUN OF THE MILL CAMPGROUND! What says agritourism more than a campground on a small-scale wool sheep farm located in the Gauley River National Recreation Area? The Tawney Farm offers a unique alternative to the overcrowded commercial campgrounds with farm camping at Gauley River Wild & Woolly Primitive Campground. Here you’re only a short drive from the New River Gorge National Park and Summersville Lake, and within walking distance of the Gauley River with all it’s wild untamed beauty where you can swim, kayak, paddleboard, or splash in a waterfall. And you get to camp on a sheep farm, where you have the opportunity to learn about wool and wool processing. You can even learn how to felt wool and take your creation home! Enjoy peaceful and private, safe and secure camping on our farm. While The Gauley River Wild & Woolly Primitive Campground might have ""primitive"" in the name, don't let that fool you. From March through Labor Day and November, we provide a total of 8 sites on our farm for camping with a site suited for every camping style! Three sites in our main field accommodate both campers and small RVs (up to 35') as well as tent and vehicle camping. Three sites are tent and vehicle camping only and two are tent only, one with a 3-minute hike and one with a 20-minute hike to the top of the mountain for incredible night skies! All sites are spaciously separate from one another where you'll feel you're the only campers here. ​And there are plenty of amenities! Park-style and fire pit grills, tables, water, hot water shower, clean portajohns and a dishwashing station. Perfect for couples who want to get away from it all, or for families or groups of friends with different camping styles who want to reconnect and catch up. During the Gauley whitewater season (the day after Labor Day through the third weekend in October), we switch to festival-style camping to welcome hundreds of rafters and kayakers from across the country to camp for the Gauley River whitewater season.

Greenbrier River Trail,"The Greenbrier River Trail is a 78-mile former railroad now used for hiking, biking and horseback riding. It is the longest trail of its kind in West Virginia. The trail provides many breathtaking views as it passes through several small towns, crosses 35 bridges, goes through two tunnels and cuts through some of West Virginia’s most remote areas. The Greenbrier River Trail is one of 50 Millennium Legacy Trails in the United States, and was rated one of the top 10 hiking trails in the country by Backpacker Magazine. Part of the Greenbrier River Trail lies within a National Radio Quiet Zone so cell phones do not work. The trail begins at Caldwell, WV near Greenbrier State Forest and passes through numerous small towns and traverses 35 bridges and 2 tunnels as it winds its way along the valley with its northern terminus at Cass Scenic Railroad State Park in Pocahontas County. Throughout much of its length, the trail is adjacent to the Greenbrier River and is flanked by peaks of the Allegheny Mountains. The surface is generally hard packed, but varies from rough to fine gravel. Several state parks and forests along the Greenbrier River Trail provide overnight accommodations.

Ice Mountain Preserve,"Ice Mountain gets its name from the refrigeration effect that takes place inside its talus — a sloping mass of boulders at the foot of the mountain. In cooler months, dense, cold air sinks deep into the talus, and ice masses form inside. As the weather warms up, the cooler air flows out of vents among the rocks at the bottom of the slope. The preserve protects a collection of boreal plants usually found much further north. Sustained by the cool air flowing from some 60 small holes and openings at the base of the talus, species such as twinflower, dwarf dogwood, Canada mayflower, and bristly rose all can be found here. The 149-acre preserve also provides habitat for breeding neotropical birds such as warblers, vireos and thrushes, as well as a collection of birds and animals that are typical of the Central Appalachians.",NA,NA,westvirginia@tnc.org,"Co Rte 45/20, West Virginia, USA",Potomac Highlands,https://maps.google.com/?cid=2221311936214221461,https://wvtourism.com/company/ice-mountain-preserve/,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,8:00 AM – 8:00 PM,8:00 AM – 8:00 PM,8:00 AM – 8:00 PM,8:00 AM – 8:00 PM,8:00 AM – 8:00 PM,8:00 AM – 8:00 PM,8:00 AM – 8:00 PM,39.351805,-78.507907,ChIJhzixzziGtYkRlUJi3W-v0x4,Capon Bridge,Hampshire County,26711,Hiking

Locomotives and cars, as well as tracks, bridges, telegraph wire, “Colonade” Bridge, B&O roundhouse and machine shops were destroyed. In 1866, the B&O began efforts to rebuild the roundhouse and associated machine chops for servicing locomotives.

Matewan Floodwall,"The town of Matewan has a unique feature that surrounds the entire downtown area – a floodwall.

Visitors walking the path see the art on the floodwall while enjoying the Tug Fork River. The floodwall may spend the majority of its time as a piece of information art, but it also serves an important function. According to the former mayor of Matewan, Robert McCoy, the town was once described as having the most severe flooding problem in the United States. This label was well earned, as according to McCoy, by 1984, the town had faced severe, property damaging flooding in 33 of the prior 35 years. The most catastrophic floods occurred in 1957, 1963, 1977 and 1984. You can see the heights that these floods reached on the steps that lead to the river, and even as high as the floodwall. Relief came in 1992 when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began constructing the 2,350-foot long floodwall.

McColloch's Leap Monument,"In September 1777, during a Native American siege on the fort, Major Samuel McColloch arrived at the fort with 40 mounted men from Short Creek. The gates of the fort were thrown open to allow the men entrance. Major McColloch lingered behind to guide and protect the men. The Indians attacked, and all of the men except McColloch made it inside before they were forced to close the gates. McColloch found himself alone and surrounded by Native Americans, and he rode immediately towards the nearby hill in an attempt to escape. McColloch had earned a reputation as a very successful ""borderer"" (one who protected the frontier borders from the Native Americans) and was well known to both the frontiersmen and the Indians. The Indians eagerly pursued McColloch, and drove him to the summit of the hill. As he rode along the top of the hill, he encountered another large body of Indians. He now found himself surrounded, with no path of escape. He knew, because of his reputation and history against the Indians, he would be tortured and killed with great cruelty if he were to be captured alive. With all avenues of escape cut off, he turned and faced the precipice, and with the bridle in his left hand and his rifle in his right, he spurred his horse over the edge to an almost certain death. The hill at that location is about 300 feet in height, and in many places is almost perpendicular. The Indians rushed to the edge, expecting to see the major lying dead in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the hill. To their great surprise, they instead saw McColloch, still mounted on his white horse, galloping away from them. As legend of this famous ""leap"" became known, the place where it occurred became known as McColloch's Leap. A historical marker now memorializes the site of his daring feat.",3.9,(800) 828-3097,info@wheelingcvb.com,"100-122 National Rd, Wheeling, WV 26003, USA",Northern Panhandle,https://maps.google.com/?cid=9527365264944397777,https://wvtourism.com/company/mccollochs-leap/,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,24 hours,24 hours,24 hours,24 hours,24 hours,24 hours,24 hours,40.0793903,-80.7227138,ChIJ3ccbTvXZNYgR0f1n9joAOIQ,Wheeling,Ohio County,26003,History & Heritage

Taylor's Farm Market,"Welcome to the area's newest Farm Market. We invite you to come check out what everyone has been talking about! We carry many West Virginia wines, local honey, different jams and jellies, apple butter, sauces from Oliverio’s Peppers in Clarksburg—in fact, we're so local that some of the honey we will be selling are from the bees that were in our apple orchard for pollinating earlier this spring! We have farm fresh produce, bulk candy, pies, organic ice cream, local meats, baking mixes, organic milk, local free range eggs from Gerrardstown, tomatoes, and much more in season. What we don’t raise ourselves, we are buying from local farmers when available so our customers will have different types of produce to choose from when they walk in our market. This is the best our great area produces, and our family is so happy to bring it all together to share with your family. Taylor's Farm Market is conveniently located right off I-81 in Inwood, WV and opened in May 2014. However, you've seen our family in the Inwood community for a long time: Nearby, owners Bob Taylor and his son Ryan Taylor farm over 1350 acres of row crops and orchards. The Taylor's farm produces over 130,000 bushels of apples, 5,000 bushels of peaches, cherries, plums, and nectarines that are sold in the farm market along with a huge variety of other local produce. Our spot right off the highway here in Inwood has been a place for wholesome, local food for a long time. In 1920 the site was originally developed into the Demonstration Community Apple Packing School. Many apple producers came here to learn best practices for packing the fruit via 12 orchards that sent 120,000 barrels of apples here. It was also a place to have the fruit inspected and graded before shipping it to market on the Cumberland Valley Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The facility was later the Inwood Farmer's Market, pictured above, although the original building pictured burned in 1955. The current building allows us sample space to share the best locally produced fruit, wines, grocery items, dairy, meat, handmade crafts, and bakery items that West Virginia proudly produces.",4.6,(304) 400-6123,info@taylorfarmsmarket.com,"178 Pilgrim St, Inwood, WV 25428, USA",Eastern Panhandle,https://maps.google.com/?cid=4879393595745792054,https://wvtourism.com/company/taylors-farm-market/,http://www.taylorfarmsmarket.com/?utm_source=Tourism&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=Tourism,TRUE,NA,NA,TRUE,TRUE,10:00 AM – 5:00 PM,10:00 AM – 5:00 PM,10:00 AM – 5:00 PM,10:00 AM – 8:00 PM,10:00 AM – 8:00 PM,10:00 AM – 8:00 PM,NA,39.361309,-78.0426483,ChIJWc3Ug5_4tYkRNnC-iZ8Wt0M,Inwood,Berkeley County,25428,Farm-To-Table

Yankauer Nature Preserve,"A popular preserve in Berkeley County, Yankauer Preserve is a blend of oak forests surrounded by glades of red cedar and dense thickets of fast-growing shrubs and trees. As you move into the center of the property you find a more mature forest of large oaks and maples growing amid limestone outcrops and sinkholes. The eastern edge of the property is a bluff overlooking the Potomac River. The mixed habitat makes the area ideal for birding. The preserve is a hot spot for Spring wildflower displays, as well as sighting warblers on migration. At least 105 species of plants have been identified on the Preserve. Clusters of wildflowers such as Dutchmen's Breeches, Jack-in-the-Pulpit, Hepatica, and Twinleaf are easily found in the spring. The autumn fruits of Paw Paw trees provide a snack for wild animals and not-so-wild hikers alike. There is equal diversity among the animals on the Preserve. Spring migration of waterfowl can be spectacular along the river. Breeding season welcomes sweet-singing warblers and vireos as they nest among the cedars. Barred Owls are often heard as they cry out in search for a mate. Three well marked trails take the visitor through a variety of habitat types on the preserve. The ""Kingfisher Trail,"" a ""South Trail,"" and ""Dan Fisher Trail"" all loop, and one can walk a large circle across the property. A trail brochure is available on site.
