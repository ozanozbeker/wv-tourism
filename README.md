# WV Tourism Map

This projects aims to showcase the culmination of my R skills across different techniques (data wrangling, web scraping, database design, dashboarding, etc.) by creating an interactive map of my home state, West Virginia. I will populate most of the information from the tourism website, <https://wvtourism.com/>.
