# WV Tourism Shiny Map

This projects aims to showcase the culmination of my R skills across different techniques (data wrangling, web scraping, database design, dashboarding, etc.) by creating an interactive Shiny map of my home state, West Virginia. I will populate most of the information from the official tourism website, <https://wvtourism.com/>. The end goal is to create an interactive dashboard that anybody can use to plan their ultimate WV vacation.

This repo will consist most of development updates and I will be creating a blog post that dives deeper into the creation process.
